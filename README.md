# 👋 Hi there, I'm Alex

I’m a software engineer, architect, and entrepreneur with more than 20 years of experience in the tech industry. I build secure, scalable, and meaningful software solutions. I believe in simple code, strong architecture, and human-centered design.

Technology for me is not just a profession — it’s a passion. From reverse-engineering hardware as a teenager to designing SaaS platforms today, I’ve always pursued a deeper understanding of how things work. I love sharing that journey with others.
